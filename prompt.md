# Match-3 Chess Game

## Game Concept
Create a web-based puzzle game that combines chess piece movements with match-3 mechanics. Players move chess pieces according to their traditional chess rules, but the goal is to create matches of 3 or more identical pieces to clear them from the board.

## Game Board
- 8x8 grid layout (traditional chess board size)
- Each cell contains a chess piece emoji
- Chess pieces to use:
  - ♟️ Pawn
  - ♞ Knight
  - ♝ Bishop
  - ♜ Rook
  - ♛ Queen
  - ♚ King

## Movement Mechanics
1. Player selects a piece to move
2. Valid moves are highlighted based on that piece's chess movement rules:
   - Pawn: One square forward
   - Knight: L-shape movement (2 squares in one direction, 1 square perpendicular)
   - Bishop: Diagonal movement any number of squares
   - Rook: Horizontal or vertical movement any number of squares
   - Queen: Any direction any number of squares
   - King: One square in any direction
3. When player selects a valid destination square, the pieces swap positions

## Match-3 Mechanics
1. After each move, check for matches:
   - Horizontal matches of 3 or more identical pieces
   - Vertical matches of 3 or more identical pieces
   - Diagonal matches of 3 or more identical pieces
2. Matched pieces are removed from the board
3. Pieces above empty spaces fall down to fill the gaps
4. New random pieces fall from the top to fill remaining empty spaces

## Game Flow
1. Initialize board with random chess pieces
2. Player selects a piece to move
3. Show valid move locations based on chess rules
4. Player selects destination to swap pieces
5. Check for and clear any matches
6. Fill empty spaces with new pieces
7. Repeat from step 2

## Visual Elements
1. Game board:
   - Chess-like grid pattern
   - Clear cell borders
   - Highlighted cells for selected piece
   - Highlighted valid move locations
2. Pieces:
   - Use chess piece emojis for clear visualization
   - Smooth animations for:
     - Piece movement/swapping
     - Piece removal
     - Pieces falling
     - New pieces appearing

## Optional Enhancements
1. Scoring system:
   - Points based on number of pieces matched
   - Bonus points for larger matches (4+ pieces)
   - Multipliers for chain reactions
2. Special moves:
   - Castling: Special king-rook swap that affects multiple pieces
   - En passant: Special pawn capture move
3. Game modes:
   - Timed mode: Complete objectives within time limit
   - Move limit mode: Score maximum points within limited moves
   - Puzzle mode: Preset board configurations with specific objectives
4. Power-ups:
   - Temporary piece upgrades
   - Board-clearing effects
   - Movement pattern modifications
5. Theme options:
   - Different piece styles
   - Various board designs
   - Custom color schemes

## Technical Considerations
1. Piece movement validation:
   - Implement chess rule checking
   - Handle edge cases for each piece type
2. Match detection:
   - Efficient algorithms for checking matches
   - Handle multiple simultaneous matches
3. Animation system:
   - Smooth transitions for all piece movements
   - Chain reaction handling
4. State management:
   - Track board state
   - Handle move history
   - Manage game progress
