# Match-3 Chess - How to Play

Welcome to Match-3 Chess, a unique puzzle game that combines chess piece movements with match-3 mechanics!

## Game Objective
Create matches of 3 or more identical chess pieces by moving pieces according to their traditional chess movement patterns.

## How to Play

1. **Select a Piece**
   - Click on any chess piece on the board to select it
   - Valid moves for that piece will be highlighted

2. **Move the Piece**
   - Click on one of the highlighted squares to move your selected piece
   - Pieces move according to their traditional chess rules:
     - ♟️ Pawn: Moves one square forward
     - ♞ Knight: Moves in an L-shape (2 squares in one direction, then 1 square perpendicular)
     - ♝ Bishop: Moves diagonally any number of squares
     - ♜ Rook: Moves horizontally or vertically any number of squares
     - ♛ Queen: Moves like a bishop or rook (diagonally, horizontally, or vertically)
     - ♚ King: Moves one square in any direction

3. **Create Matches**
   - When 3 or more identical pieces are aligned horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, they will be removed
   - You earn 100 points for each piece in a match

4. **Chain Reactions**
   - After matches are removed, pieces will fall to fill empty spaces
   - New pieces will appear at the top of the board
   - If new matches form after pieces fall, they will automatically be removed, creating chain reactions

5. **Strategy Tips**
   - Plan your moves to set up potential chain reactions
   - Remember that different pieces have different movement capabilities
   - Try to create situations where multiple matches can form with a single move

## Winning the Game
This is a score-based game with no specific end condition. Try to achieve the highest score possible by creating large matches and chain reactions!

Enjoy playing Match-3 Chess!
